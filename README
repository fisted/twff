this program prints information about whats currently going on in the teeworlds world.
it will contact master- and game servers, print the requested information, and terminate.
hence, for a continous view, its best run in combination with watch, or in the background 
writing to a file, with watch/tail as its front end.

for a list of supported parameters, run ./twff -h

if you want to see whats going on (to make sure its not stuck), call it with -v
